### Introduction

The HPC GEMM benchmark measures the floating point rate of execution of single/double precision real matrix-matrix multiplication.

### Test Case

Currently, there is only build-in single node support / test case.
There are three defined test cases: 
- `sgemm_gated`: This test case is a quick test designed for CI commit validation. It is single precision.
- `dgemm_gated`: This test case is a quick test designed for CI commit validation. It is double precision.
- `sgemm_pkm`: This test case is the common use case of GEMM designed for Post-Si performance analysis.

And this workload provides sub test cases with the following configurable parameters:
- **FLOAT_TYPE**: Specify which float type to use (single precision or double precision): 
> 1. `sgemm`
> 2. `dgemm`
- **MATH_LIB**: Specify which math library to use (For BLIS version, you should use skylake or higher version to run.): 
> 1. `mkl`
> 2. `blis`
- **PROBLEM_SIZE**: The problem size of square matrix. 
- **OMP_NUM_THREADS**: Number of OpenMP threads setting. The number of OMP threads should be at least 1 and no more than the number of physical cores in the single node. The following options can be used:
> 1. a specific number
> 2. `numa`: Using core number in one NUMA node
> 3. `socket`: Using core number in one socket
> 4. `max`: Using core number in one node

### Docker Image

The workload provides 2 Docker images: `gemm` and `gemm-srf`. `gemm` supports AVX512 and `gemm-srf` supports AVX2. Both images support double and single precision float; Run the workload as follows

```

There are two float types "sgemm" or "dgemm" and two math libaries  `mkl` or `blis` supported. Use the -e flag to pass the type of float(double or single precision); pass the type of math library (mkl or blis); pass the matrix size for multiplication; pass the number of threads for parallel run.
mkdir -p logs
id=$(docker run --rm --detach --privileged -e MATHLIB=mkl -e FLOAT_TYPE=sgemm gemm -e MATRIX_SIZE=4000 -e OMP_NUM_THREADS=64 gemm)
docker exec $id cat /export-logs | tar xf - -C logs
docker rm -f $id

```

### KPI

Run the [`kpi.sh`](kpi.sh) script to parse the KPIs from the validation logs. 
- **`Throughput (GFlop/s)`**: Billion floating operations per second.
The following KPIs are generated:
- **`SGEMM Performance`**: single precision matrix multiplication.
- **`DGEMM Performance`**: double precison matrix multiplication.


### System Requirements
IntelÂ® AVX-512 support.
