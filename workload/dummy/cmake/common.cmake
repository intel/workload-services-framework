# The add_testcase function adds a test case, which will be executed through
# validate.sh. The test case name must be unique and avoid any special
# characters except _. Any arguments to add_testcase will be passed literally
# to validate.sh. See CMakeLists.txt for details. You can define any number
# of test cases here but there are special test cases that every workload
# must have as follows:

# Define at least a _pkm test case (and no more than two) for the most common use case.
add_testcase(${workload}_pi_pkm 2000)

# Define at least a gated test case for commit validation. The gated test case
# must be short and cover most of the workload features.

# Define additional test cases as needed
