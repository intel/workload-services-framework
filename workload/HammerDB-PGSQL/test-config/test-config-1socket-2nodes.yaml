# This is a two node scenario, we have a client SUT and server SUT respectively
# Client SUTs are two-socket platform with 128 cores per socket
# Server SUTs are two-socket plafrom with 64 cores per socket
# We would like to let server instances start from socket 1 and client instances start from socket 0
# and let server instance fully used all cores on socket 1
# if SERVER_CORES_PI=4, we will need 64 cores/SERVER_CORES_PI=16 DB_INSTANCE to fully used all cores on socket 1
# for client SUTs, if we want to fully used all cores on socket 0, we can make CLIENT_CORES_PI bigger, 128/16=8
